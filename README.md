## Goals

- Build a React-TypeScript-Material UI Front End Project to practice and also deply it.

## Intro

As a challenge I dive into TypeScript and Material UI. After mastering JavaScript in front and back end it was time to practice with a more object oriented lenguage (not actually a lenguage, but you know)
For your visit, cheers.
